                <p>As I started my academic career in Computer Engineering I felt extremely behind other students. Coming from a different field of study meant I had a lot to learn and catch up.
                    One of the things I was unfamiliar with was website development. I also needed a better online presence for myself and my projects. This website is an attempt at that. It started as a poorly put-together collection of shapes and text, but as I started learning more about HTML and CSS techniques it started to look more pleasing and include more and more project information.
                    While I don't consider this to be a final product as there are still many things I would like to implement and learn about in web design, this is now a project I can be proud of and one that taught me valuable skills.
